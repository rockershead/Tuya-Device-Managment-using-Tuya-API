# Tuya-Device-Managment-using-Tuya-API

Tuya Inc. is a Chinese artificial intelligence and Internet of things platform as a service provider founded in 2014. 
The company provides a cloud development and management platform to developers, brands, and OEMs to program, manage, and monetize smart home and IoT devices.

Tuya also provides an API service to control these IOT devices.These devices can be a smart plug or smart thermostat.So this repo will teach how to authenticate to the API and access relevant data like energy readings and be able to control these devices(ON and OFF) using the API. I will be using node.js to create this application
